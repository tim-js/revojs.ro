Dear community members, JavaScript enthusiasts, conferences attendees, and revo.js supporters.

It's true. For the time being, **revo.js will remain an offline event**. The Covid-19 pandemic is forcing us to postpone any in-person activity, which means that revo.js will be on-hold until offline events will be legally allowed again and safe to host.

In this post, we’d like to give you more details regarding the reasons behind this decision.

## Why not host it online?

The reason [we organized revo.js](/about/#why-are-we-organizing-this-conference) in the first place was to **bring speakers close to the audience**. Honestly, the world doesn't need one more JavaScript conference, there are plenty of them. However, **Timisoara/RO needs its own JavaScript conference** and that's the reason revo.js came to be. So, if we cannot fulfill our primary motivation, there's no actual reason for revo.js to take place.

Online events are great for connecting attendees around the world, but an online revo.js doesn't bring any additional value, neither to the local community, nor to the global one.

## What's next?

We don't want to give you the impression that we’ve given up on revo.js. Not at all. We're still alive and kickin'.

We'll analyze the local and global situation at the end of 2021 and decide if a 2022 edition is possible. However, if it won’t be in the books for next year, we'll increment the counters and re-iterate.

**We're confident and optimistic** that things _will_ get better and we _will_ be able to get together, be it sooner or later.

## Thank you for your support

We'd like to express our appreciation for those who support us morally, practically, or financially:

- our **invited speakers**, and all the **speakers who applied to our Call for Papers**, because without you the stage would be empty;
- our **sponsors** and **partners**, because without you we wouldn't be able to rise to the desired quality level;
- our **attendees**, because you're the main reason why revo.js takes place;
- the **JavaScript communities** for spreading the word, because without you we’d have reached only the ears of Timisoara’s locals;
- all **our friends** for their helping hand, their advice, and their constructive criticism;
- everybody in the **organizing team**, because it takes a village to raise a child.

To those mentioned above and to those we hope will <strong>join us</strong> in the coming years, <strong>thank you</strong>, and <strong class="accent">see you all soon...</strong>.
