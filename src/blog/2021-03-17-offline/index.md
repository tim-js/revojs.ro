Dear community members, JavaScript enthusiasts, conferences attendees, revo.js supporters and pandemic survivors.

It's true! For the time being, **revo.js will remain an offline event**. The Covid-19 world pandemic is forcing us to put on hold any in-person activity, which means that revo.js will be on-hold until offline events will be legally allowed again.

In the next paragraphs, we would like to explain reasons behind this decision.

## Why not online?

The main reason [why we organized revo.js](/about/#why-are-we-organizing-this-conference) in the first place was to **bring speakers close to the audience**. Honestly, the world doesn't need any more JavaScript conferences, there are plenty of them.

But **Timisoara/RO needs its JavaScript conference** and that's the reason revo.js came to be. So, if we cannot fulfill our primary motivation, there's no actual reason for revo.js to take place.

Online events are great for connecting attendees around the world, but an online revo.js doesn't bring any additional value, not to the local community, nor to the global one.

## What's next?

We don't want to give you the impression that revo.js is history. Not at all. We're still live and kickin'.

We'll analyze the local and global situation at the end of 2021 and decide if a 2022 edition is possible. If not, we'll increment the counters and re-iterate.

**We're confident and optimistic** that things _will_ get better and we _will_ be able to get together.

## We still need your support

We'd like to give our appreciations to everybody and anybody that supports us in any way, regardless if it's physically, psychically, financially or morally:

- our **invited speakers** and **all speakers that applied to our Call for papers**, because without you the stage would be empty;
- our **sponsors** and **partners**, because without you, we wouldn't be able to rise to the desired quality level;
- our **attendees**, because without you, the speakers would talk like radios, to an empty room;
- the **JavaScript communities** for spreading the word, because without you only the locals would have known about the event;
- all **our friends** for their helping hands, their advice and their constructive criticism;
- everybody involved in the **organizing team**, because it takes a village to raise a child.

See you soon...
