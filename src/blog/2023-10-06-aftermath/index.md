The second edition of [revo.js](https://revojs.ro/2023) finally took place between **5-6 October 2023**, after an unexpected 3 year pandemic break.

The event was **sold out** one month in advance, gathering more than **300 participants** and **15 speakers** from 10 countries (and 4 continents), during two conference days.

---

The [organizing team](/2023/organizers) started the preparations for revo.js 2023 during the summer of 2022, more than one year before the event. The core team suffered minor changes (ie: _design_ & _sponsorship_), while some roles were ajusted to accomodate the new structure.


## Budget

revo.js follows the [JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/) initiative and publish a transparent budget report.

Our total initial estimated budget, calculated in the summer of 2022, was around **110.000 EUR**. We planned to raise around 60% of the required budget from sponsors and the rest of 40% through tickets.

We managed to raise **64.000 EUR** through sponsorships and **34.000 EUR** from tickets sales, bringing us to a total budget of **98.000 EUR**, a bit lower than initially estimated. Sponsorships played a big role in this regard, as we experienced first hand the budget cuts within the marketing departments of tech companies.

### Expenses breakdown

Cost wise, we had to adjust our spendings to accomodate a lower than estimated budget, the uncertainty regarding ticket sales, but also the general increase in prices in all industries.

In the end, the total cost for revo.js 2023 was around **82.000 EUR**. Here's a breakdown of the main categories of costs:

- **30.000 EUR** for the venue, food, beverages, and after-party;
- **24.000 EUR** for the speakers’ travel, accommodation, dinner, field trip;
- **12.500 EUR** for services’ fees: design, marketing, live captions, ticketing platform, taxes, and accouting;
- **12.000 EUR** for audio/video/photo services, technical staff and equipment;
- **3.500 EUR** for prints, t-shirts, badges, sponsors’ panels, and branding elements.

<br />

Doing some math, we end up with **16.000 EUR** profit. Most of the extra money resulted from an extra sponsor that joined late in the summer, some speakers that covered their travel costs, and changing the venue.

Since revo.js is a not-for-profit event, we will use the extra money to grow the local JavaScript community as well as to reinvest them in the next edition of revo.js.

## The good parts

To analyze what went well during this edition, let's look exclusively at the participants' feedback. Below is a list of recurring highlighted aspects that the attendees enjoyed most about this year's edition of revo.js.

### Networking

About 25% of the feedback we received highlighted the networking opportunities with other JavaScript professionals. We were delighted to see that because that's the reason we kept revo.js as an offline event in the first place. Watching talks online or attending online events are great for their content, but they lack social engagement.

### Content

At the heart of any technical conference are the talks, which in our case were highly appreciated and were described by participants as being "**diverse**", "**high-quality**", "**useful**", "**relevant**", and "**educative**".

### Talks/Breaks balance

Just like the previous edition, we followed the same pattern of 2 talks of 30 minutes each, followed by a break of 30 minutes. About 10% of the participants mentioned that they've enjoyed the most the relaxed pace of the event and the balance between the breaks and the talks. That's a confirmation that we shouldn't change this.

### Organization

We were pleased to see that many participants appreciated the overall organization efforts including **live captions**, smooth **registration** process, **branding**, and more. We put a lot of effort into all of these areas, so it's rewarding to know that they didn't go unnoticed.

### Sound & Video quality

The last (which was also the first) edition of revo.js we have relied heavily on the technical equipment from the venue, which was not great. That's why we've put extra effort to make sound quality a top priority. In addition, we have also opted for a large LED screen which also allowed us to overlay the live captions.

### Coding challenges

Unsurprisingly, several participants mentioned in their feedback that what they enjoyed the most during revo.js were the coding challenges put in place by our Coding Experience Sponsor, Victory Square Partners. We'll definitely keep that in mind for the next edition.

### Overall vibe

Last but not least, a recurring feedback was in regard to the **overall atmosphere** at the event and the **general good vibe**. This was again quite fulfilling for us, as we invested time and effort to achieve this result, from the music during the breaks, to our host and MC Diana, who represented and communicated beautifully the vibe that we were looking for.

## Things to improve

In the end, the event was far from perfect. We still have a long way to go and even we, as organizers, have some self criticism to address, part of which was shared through feedback.

### More advanced content

We are aware that any speaker lineup we might have, there will always be someone that would not like it, finding it either too advanced, or too basic, or too much framework X, or too little something else.

However, 25% of the feedback mentioned that the overall level of the talks could have been **more advanced** and more **live coding**. Since all participants spend their work day writing code, it's definitely easier to understand code while it's being written or executed during a **live demo**. We'll definitely put this point on out bullet list for the next edition.

### Poor catering

The problems with the catering, that we identified ourselves as well, were multiple. First, the coffee machines were too few, resulting on long queues during the breaks. Second, the lunch setup was really inefficient, resulting again in very long queues which could have been drastically reduced.

We didn't get involved into any aspects of the catering, since we were expected everything to go smooth. We put extra effort into the technical part, which we knew we had to address ourselves, but neglected the catering. We'll definitely have to get involved into this area in future events.

### The venue

We got mixed feedback regarding the venue. Some liked it, others didn't. As organizers, we have a similar dilema because we know the strengths and weaknesses of the location. The sad part is that there's not much of a choice really in regard to tech event venues in Timisoara. Hopefully, new locations will be built in the near future.

## Next steps

Before we close this retrospective, we'll have to address one of the elephants in the room, which is the next edition. We have decided to skip 2024 and focus on a potential edition in 2025. The reasons are entirely internal: the 2023 edition was quite difficult and we need some rest, but we also need to reconfigure our core team, which will take some time.

In the mean time, don't forget to visit the [media page](/2023/media) if you want to (re)watch any of the talk, look over the photos, or feel the vibe of the event by watching the after movie.

We'd like to give a huge thank you to all our [supporters](/2023/supporters), including sponsors, communities, and friends, to the [organizing team](/2023/organizers), including the volunteers which helped during the event, to our [speakers](/2023/speakers) for sharing their knowledge with us, and last but not least, to all our participants for attending revo.js 2023.

**See you all next edition!**
