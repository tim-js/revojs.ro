            <h2>What are Diversity Scholarship Tickets?</h2>

            <p>
              We created the <strong>revo.js Diversity Scholarships</strong> to
              nurture inclusiveness in our tech community, while generating
              broader connection opportunities. Our goal is to create a{" "}
              <strong>safe and welcoming environment</strong> for ALL tech
              professionals.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’re aware that various circumstances could make attending a
              conference difficult, if not impossible. Personal or financial
              issues might impede you to attend, but our community has your
              back.
            </p>

            <p>
              We want to help{" "}
              <strong>
                underrepresented, underprivileged or marginalized tech
                professionals
              </strong>{" "}
              by offering free tickets. Our Diversity Scholarship is available,
              but not limited to minorities, members of the LGBTQIA+ community,
              people with disabilities (hearing, visual or physical), students
              or individuals facing economic difficulties.
            </p>
