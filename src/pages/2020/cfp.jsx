          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Guidelines</h2>

            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>English. Inglese. Engelsk. Angleško. Angolul.</strong>
              <br />
              But we’d love for you to teach us some words in your native
              language too.
            </p>

            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>
              The standard duration for all talks is <strong>30 minutes</strong>
              . For a more dynamic routine, we’ll also throw in a few shorter or
              longer presentations, if applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since we’ll be on a tight schedule, we strongly suggest that you
              time your presentation accordingly in advance.
            </p>

            <h3>Attention to details</h3>
            <p>
              Make sure you care, and make sure we see you care. Content is king
              but formatting and correct spelling are the crown jewels that
              ensure a royal proposal.
            </p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Keep it short and simple. If you need more than two paragraphs to
              explain your talk, you’re not there yet. Narrow your description
              or narrow the subjects you want to cover.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask yourself "
              <strong>
                What should the attendees walk away with after the talk?
              </strong>
              ". Uncovering the takeaways will help you discover what your talk
              is really about.
            </p>

            <h3>Delivery</h3>
            <p>
              Give us a taste of your delivery style by sharing a recording of
              any other talk you gave in the past (on a conference stage, at a
              local meetup, or in your living room).
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>
                This is not mandatory, but it will win you extra-extra points
                during the selection phase.
              </i>
            </p>

            <h3>Originality</h3>
            <p>
              We generally discourage "second-hand" talks as we are looking for{" "}
              <strong>crisp and fresh content</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if you have a great talk that required a lot of
              preparation, or is focused on a live experience, we would
              definitely want it on stage. We encourage you to give it a twist,
              adapt it for our audience and make it `feel like brand new`.
