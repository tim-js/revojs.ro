              We expect all participants to follow these rules at all times

            <h2>Enforcement</h2>
            <p>
              If a participant engages in any harassing behavior, the conference
              organisers reserve the right to take any action deemed
              appropriate, including expelling the offender from the conference{" "}
              <strong className="highlight">with no refund</strong> and refusing
              future admission to conference-related events.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
              particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images or
              activities. Booth staff (including volunteers) are forbidden to
              use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
              sexualised environment through any means.

              Our conference staff can be easily identified as they are wearing
              branded clothing and/or badges. They are happy to help
              participants contact the venue security or the local law
              enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist and support
              those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
              conference.
