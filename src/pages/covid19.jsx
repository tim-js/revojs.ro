              We are constantly monitoring the evolution of the COVID-19
              pandemic in Romania and worldwide. We are also constantly in
              contact with other conference organizers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Undoubtedly, the coronavirus spread will have rippling effects on
              a lot of events, but we hope the pandemic will be contained soon.

              Even though October seems far enough to be considered a safe
              month, we must be cautious and think of all possible scenarios. In
              case the current crisis won’t be resolved until mid-summer, we
              might have to cancel revo.js 2020 and prepare for next year's
              edition.
            </p>

            <p>
              <Text bold>IMPORTANT:</Text> In case we'll have to cancel this
              year's event, you’ll either receive a full refund for your ticket
              or you’ll be able to use your ticket for next year's edition.
