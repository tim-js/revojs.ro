                Revo.js 2019 will take place at the{" "}
                <strong>Multifunctional Venue of CJT</strong> or Consiliul
                Județean Timiș (<strong>Timiș County Council</strong>
                ).

              <p>
                The venue address is: Bulevardul Revoluției din 1989 nr. 17,
                Timișoara 300034.

                It's a 15-minute walk from the hotel.
              </p>
              <h3>AV / Technical</h3>
              <p>
                The venue is equipped with a Full HD 1080P projector, having a
                1920x1080 resolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                On stage there will be an HDMI connection. We'll provide mini-DP
                and USB-C adapters if needed. If you need another type of
                adapter in order to connect your laptop to the HDMI, please
                bring your own.
              </p>
              <p>

              <h3>WIFI</h3>
              <p>
                The venue has WIFI, but you should prepare your talk and demos
                as if there is no Internet connection available, as it might not
                function properly due to the large number of people who will use
                it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Be sure to make yourself familiar with the conference schedule
                and the time of your talk.

                <strong>at least 2 hours before</strong> it is your turn to
                enter the stage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The talks will be presented in pairs and there will be a break
                before each pair. During that break, we will need to make sure
                that everything related to your presentation works as expected.
              </p>
              <h3>Content accessibility</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  There will be visually impaired people among the participants
